# M1 Mac Development Environment - homebrew, zsh, Ruby, Python, Nodejs
- setup M1 dev environment w/o having to create 2nd terminal icon using rosetta
- creates separate aliases (mzsh, izsh) to install to different paths


```sh
mzsh # M1/arm64 alias to install to /opt/homebrew/bin/brew
izsh # Rosetta/intel/i386 alias to install to /usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew
```
